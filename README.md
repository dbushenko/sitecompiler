## Usage

### Config file

The distribution contains an example of a site for generation. This example site consists of a directory "site" and file "config.clj". Yes, "config.clj" is a part of site example, not the sitecompiler engine.

In "config.clj"  you may specify the follosing options:

* :input-dir -- the directory where the input files (articles) are stored. Default value is "input".
* :output-dir -- the directory where all generated files are stored. Default value is "output".
* :templates-dir -- the directory where all page templates are stored. Default values is "templates".
* :pages-in-list -- how many pages are shown in a list. Default value is 5.

You also may specify how to generate the pages. For single pages (which are not included in lists) you may specify the following options:

 :single-pages [{:file-name "promo"
                 :template "main"}
                {:file-name "authors"
                :template "authors"}]}

Here "single-pages" specifies, that the vector contains information how to generate single pages.		

* :file-name -- the file name (without the file extension).
* :template -- the template name (without the file extension) which should be applied to this file.

Following config option describes how to generate lists of articles:

 :tags-pages [{:tag "index"
               :list-template "index"
               :page-template "main"}]

* tag -- which tag to search for. If an article contains this tag, then it is included in the list.	       
* :list-template -- the template name (without extension) which describes how to generate the list of files.
* :page-template -- the template name (without extension) for generating individual pages from this list.

Run this config file as following:

	$ lein run config.clj

### Input files
	
The format of the input file should consist of following:

1. Header lines (one or more) -- the lines starting from the # sign.
2. Empty line.
3. Text of the input file.

The format of a header line is the following:

    #header-name: header value

Header name may be any string not containing whitespaces and colon sign. The value of this header is the rest of the string after the colon. For example:

    #date: 2014-04-26

This line creates a header "date" with value "2014-04-26".

There is one special header type -- #tags. This header contains a list of tags for this file separated by whitespaces.

### Templates

The following values are available within the template:

* prev -- for previous list file name;
* next -- for next list file name;
* current -- current list file name;
* files -- all input files within this list file;
* tag -- current tag for which this list was generated;
* latest -- latest file.

The "files" contains a sequence of hash-maps containing all the headers of the file and "content" for the content of this file.
